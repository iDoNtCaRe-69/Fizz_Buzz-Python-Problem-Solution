## Introduction
Yet Another Simplified Solution For Our UnDisputed FizzBuzz Python Quiz. Well This IS the Most Widely Used Question Right Now It Doesn't Matter What Language You Know, This Shit Might Appear Before You While Going Through Interviews Or Internship Or Who Knows Maybe In Exam.

   So Yeah I am Just A Noob Like You Are, Recently Started Learning My First Proframming LAnguage As Python & I Can Say Without A Doubt That Coding Sucks, It's Intresting Untill You Learn. Anyway I Am Not Roasting Any Devs Instead I Respect Them From The BOttom Of My Heart For Writing Such Freaking Lines For Us Noobs. Love You devs. (Smiley Face)
   
## Rules Of The Game/Quiz/WhatEver

Rules Might Differ, Like In Some Cases It's 2 & 3 And Also In Some Cases It's 3 & 5. Remember That No Matter What, Solution Remains Same(For Python3 Users) Just Digits Will Change. For This Time I Am Using 3 & 5.

* If Input Is Divisable By 3 Then Print Fizz
* If Divisable By 5 Then Print Buzz
* If Divisable By Both 3 & 5 Then Print FizzBuzz

## Solution

Here We Go Finally The Solution. So [Click Here](./app.py) & Also Read Below Texts For Some Possible Doubts.

You Might Be Wondering Where Did This 15 Came Fromn? It's Pretty Straight Forward, If Any Number IS Divisable By Both Values Then That Number Is Also Divisable By Multiplication Of Those Twp Digits. Think Practically Like,

In Tables Of Both 3 & 5, Common Numbers Are 15, 30, 45, 60 And So On & By The Looks Of It They Are In Table Of 15 In Perfect Order. I Don't Think Any More Explanation Needed. Same Goes For 2 & 3, Thrie Commonly Divisable Numbers Are In The Table Of 6 Which Completely Makes Sense.
